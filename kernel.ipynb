    "* Iris Setosa\n",

    "* sepal width\n",
    "* petal length \n",
    "* petal width\n",
    " \n",
    "The Iris data set has a number of interesting features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why am I  using iris dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n",
    "\n",
    "6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n",
    "### 3-2 Aim\n",

    "The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a **multivariate data set** introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\n",
    "The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n",

    "A Bagging classifier is an ensemble **meta-estimator** that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.\n",

If samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging . When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces . Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches .[http://scikit-learn.org]"
