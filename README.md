## 1- Introduction
This is a **comprehensive ML techniques with python** , that I have spent for more than two months to complete it.

it is clear that everyone in this community is familiar with IRIS dataset but if you need to review your information about the dataset please visit this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

I have tried to help **beginners**  in Kaggle how to face machine learning problems. and I think it is a great opportunity for who want to learn machine learning workflow with python completely.
I have covered most of the methods that are implemented for iris until **2018**, you can start to learn and review your knowledge about ML with a simple dataset and try to learn and memorize the workflow for your journey in Data science world.

I am open to getting your feedback for improving this **kernel**

## 2- Machine Learning Workflow
Field of 	study 	that 	gives	computers	the	ability 	to	learn 	without 	being
explicitly 	programmed.

Arthur	Samuel, 1959

If you have already read some [machine learning books](https://towardsdatascience.com/list-of-free-must-read-machine-learning-books-89576749d2ff). You have noticed that there are different ways to stream data into machine learning.

most of these books share the following steps (checklist):
*   Define the Problem(Look at the big picture)
*   Specify Inputs & Outputs
*   Data Collection
*   Exploratory data analysis
*   Data Preprocessing
*   Model Design, Training, and Offline Evaluation
*   Model Deployment, Online Evaluation, and Monitoring
*   Model Maintenance, Diagnosis, and Retraining

**You can see my workflow in the below image** :

**you should	feel free	to	adapt 	this	checklist 	to	your needs**
## 2-1 Real world Application Vs Competitions

<a id="3"></a> <br>
## 3- Problem Definition
I think one of the important things when you start a new machine learning project is Defining your problem. that means you should understand business problem.( **Problem Formalization**)

Problem Definition has four steps that have illustrated in the picture below:
<img src="http://s8.picofile.com/file/8338227734/ProblemDefination.png">
<a id="4"></a> <br>
### 3-1 Problem Feature
we will use the classic Iris data set. This dataset contains information about three different types of Iris flowers:

* Iris Versicolor
* Iris Virginica
* Iris Setosa

The data set contains measurements of four variables :

* sepal length 
* sepal width
* petal length 
* petal width
 
The Iris data set has a number of interesting features:

1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.

2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.

3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.

**Why am I  using iris dataset:**

1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.

2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.

3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.

4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.

5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).

6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]

7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.
<a id="5"></a> <br>
### 3-2 Aim
The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals
<a id="6"></a> <br>
### 3-3 Variables
The variables are :
**sepal_length**: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
**sepal_width**: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
**petal_length**: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
**petal_width**: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.
**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.
**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.
**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as target.

**<< Note >>**
> You must answer the following question:
How does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.

## 4- Inputs & Outputs
<a id="8"></a> <br>
### 4-1 Inputs
**Iris** is a very popular **classification** and **clustering** problem in machine learning and it is such as "Hello world" program when you start learning a new programming language. then I decided to apply Iris on  20 machine learning method on it.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a **multivariate data set** introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

As a result, **iris dataset is used as the input of all algorithms**.

### 4-2 Outputs
the outputs for our algorithms totally depend on the type of classification or clustering algorithms.
the outputs can be the number of clusters or predict for new input.

**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.
**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.
**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as a target.

 Now we import all of them 
 
<a id="16"></a> <br>
## 6- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
 In this section, you'll learn how to use graphical and numerical techniques to begin uncovering the structure of your data. 
 
* Which variables suggest interesting relationships?
* Which observations are unusual?

By the end of the section, you'll be able to answer these questions and more, while generating graphics that are both insightful and beautiful.  then We will review analytical and statistical operations:

*   5-1 Data Collection
*   5-2 Visualization
*   5-3 Data Preprocessing
*   5-4 Data Cleaning
<img src="http://s9.picofile.com/file/8338476134/EDA.png">
<a id="17"></a> <br>
## 6-1 Data Collection
**Data collection** is the process of gathering and measuring data, information or any variables of interest in a standardized and established manner that enables the collector to answer or test hypothesis and evaluate outcomes of the particular collection.[techopedia]

**Iris dataset**  consists of 3 different types of irises‚Äô (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray

The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.[6]

<a id="18"></a> <br>
## 6-2 Visualization
**Data visualization**  is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.

With interactive visualization, you can take the concept a step further by using technology to drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how it‚Äôs processed.[SAS]

 In this section I show you  **11 plots** with **matplotlib** and **seaborn** that is listed in the blew picture:
